/**
 * A <code>PortletURI</code> represents a URI to a specific portlet function.
 * A URI is created through the
 * {@link org.gridlab.gridsphere.portlet.PortletResponse} for a specific
 * portlet mode. Then additional parameter can be added to the URI, which can
 * finally be converted to a string which is ready for embedding into markup.
 * On top of the parameters, it is possible to add actions to a portlet URI.
 * Actions are portlet-specific activities that need to be performed as result
 * of the incoming request, but before the service() method of the portlet is
 * called. For example, the <code>EDIT</code> mode of the portlet is likely
 * to have a "Save" button at the end of its dialog. The "Save" button has to
 * bring the user back to the <code>VIEW</code> mode of the portlet,
 * but to save the personalized portlet data, the portlet needs to be able to
 * process the posted data before the next markup is generated. This can be
 * achieved by adding a "Save" action to the URI that represents the "Save"
 * button. The respective listener is attached the respective action listener
 * to the portlet response. This listener will be called when the next request
 * comes and one of the portlet URIs where the reason for the request. If more
 * than one URI were part of the response, the listener need to the check the
 * action content. This depends on the definition of the actual action which is
 * the responsibility of the portlet developer.
