<b>GridSphere Portlet API Implementation</b>
<p>
The GridSphere Portlet API is an implementation based upon the GridLab Portal
Technical Specification. The Portlet API presented has been based largely on
the IBM WebSphere Portlet API 4.1.
<p>

In general the implementation classes follow the "Sportlet" naming convention.
Most of the implementing classes follow the Decorator pattern of simply wrapping
the corresponding Servlet object using composition. In addition, classes that
must be persistent use the Castor Java SQL bindings and Castor doclets.
