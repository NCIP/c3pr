  Grid Portlets Known Issues

  This file serves as a collection of known issues or
  "gotchas". Please visit this file every so often and
  monitor the gridsphere-dev and gridsphere-user mail
  lists for other issues that may occur when using Grid
  Portlets and the Grid technologies it depends upon.

===========================================================

4. WSRF-4.0.1 and GridFtp

With WSRF-4.0.1, GridFtp get commands appear not to be
working properly. In some cases timeout errors are thrown
and in others, data is simply not transferred properly.

OGSA-3.2.1 does not suffer this problem.

3. WSRF-4.0.1 and logging

It seems when WSRF 4.0.1 jars are deployed to:

  ${CATALINA_HOME}/gridportlets/webapp/WEB-INF/lib

Grid Portlets is unable to log.

So now, by default, Grid Portlets will deploy WSRF 4.0.1
jars to:

  ${CATALINA_HOME}/gridportlets/webapp/WEB-INF/lib

You can set which version of the Globus Toolkit core jars
to deploy and where in the file:

  config/build/globus.properties

See the following properties:

   - globus.version
   - globus.deploy.core

2. JFreeChart (MDS profile in the Resource Browser Portlet)

On hosts with no X11 server running on them you will need
to add java.awt.headless=true to the JAVA_OPTS environment
variable in order to see information from MDS. For example,
in a Unix / Linux c shell envionrment you might type:

setenv JAVA_OPTS -Djava.awt.headless=true

before starting Tomcat.

1. MyProxy 0.6.1 and Globus 3.2

There is a well known problem with using MyProxy 0.6.1 and
Globus 3.2, where using Grid Ftp in the File Browser Portlet
is known to fail with credentials retrieved from a MyProxy
0.6.1 server. The resulting error looks like the following
in $CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out:

org.globus.common.ChainedIOException: Authentication failed [Root error
message: Failure unspecified at GSS-API level [Root error message:
[Root error message: null]]].  Root exception is
GSSException: Failure unspecified at GSS-API level [Root error message:
[Root error message: null]].  Root exception is
org.globus.common.ChainedCertificateException:  [Root error message:
null].  Root exception is
java.io.EOFException
at
org.bouncycastle.asn1.DERInputStream.readObject(DERInputStream.java:235)
at
org.globus.gsi.bc.BouncyCastleUtil.toDERObject(BouncyCastleUtil.java:79)

If you are using Globus 3.2, we recommend you upgrade
to MyProxy 0.6.2. Please visit the MyProxy Project Website
at http://grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/myproxy/ for more information.

This problem was reported to the gridShere-dev mail list
by Rene Salmon <rsalmon@tulane.edu>. See the mail entitled
"Re: [Gridsphere-dev] unable to connect to grid ftp
resource" dated 25 October 2004.
