===========================================================
	Welcome to GridSphere's Grid Portlets!
===========================================================

The Grid Portlets web application builds upon the core
features in the GridSphere portal framework to provide
developers with a framework for developing Grid portals.
Grid Portlets offers developers a collection of "portlet
services" for performing tasks on the Grid. These portlet
services can be used to easily Grid-enable any GridSphere
web application!

Grid Portlets also provides a collection of simple,
easy-to-use, well integrated portlets that showcase
the functionality offered in Grid Portlets. These portlets
include the core functionality we think every Grid portal
should contain and can be used on their own or in
conjunction with custom Grid-enabled web applications
to provide a complete Grid portal solution!
