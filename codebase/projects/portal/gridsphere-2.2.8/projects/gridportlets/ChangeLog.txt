    Grid Portlets 1.3.2 Web Application Change Log
===========================================================

Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.3.1
==================================================

+ Fixed GridPortlets resource bundle utiliy so that it
uses EN bundle if no bundle exists for the requested
locale.

+ Fixed bug in how JobSpec file stage in and stage
out parameters are saved. Was previoiusly not saving
the correct file stage parameter type.

+ GridPortlets persistence manager no longer implements
GridSphere's persistence manager interface.

+ Logging with an improved format in log4j.properties

+ Bundling log4j.properties with jars in shared/lib in
proper location now (at some point, build.xml was modified
to this in the wrong location)

Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.2.1
==================================================

+ Credential Manager Portlet no longer provides options for
specifying "Single Sign-On" and "Use Portal Credential".
Single sign-on is now a default mechanism of the Credential
Auth Module and settings for using portal credential to
authenticate to MyProxy are specified with the
<myproxy-resource> tag in the Resource Registry, with the
"userPortalCredential" attribute.

+ Added the ability to set the "project" for a Job in the
Job Spec interface. This is not currently a feature in the
Job Submission Portlet howeve, and may be introduced in a
future release.

+ Fixed a GridFtp get bug. GridFtp get was not able to
retrieve directories to the localhost.

+ Fixed incompability with GS 2.1.4. Removed hack in
GridSphere User Utility to create a new user if one does not
exist.

+ A bunch of other minor improvements this developer can no
longer recall. ;-)


Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.2.0
==================================================

+ Fixed bug in File Activity Portet. Upload tasks were not
displaying proper summary information.

+ Fixed bug in file stage parameter where staged files were
being staged with query information attached. Thanks to
Emir Imamagic for this fix!

+ Fixed bug in downloading of files from File Browser
Portlet. This involved directing the user to a separate
page that presents a link to the file. Apparently the
download event supported by the GridSphere Portlet API
Action Portlet is not supported by the GridSphere JSR
168 compliant Action Portlet.

+ Fixed bug in transferring binary files with Grid Ftp.
This involved setting the client mode to Session.IMAGE.
It appears to work for both ASCII and binary files.

Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.1.2
==================================================

+ Introduced ability to set authentication type and timeout
  for all ldap resources (i.e. GRIS / GIIS resources).

Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.1.1
==================================================

+ Fixed persistence bug.

+ Introduced ability to configure Credential Manager
  Service to store credentials in files.

Changes to Grid Portlets since Grid Portlets 1.0.3
==================================================

+ Introduced org.gridlab.gridsphere.services.file.FileHandle
  for reading/writing to files. This included some enhancements
  to the org.gridlab.gridsphere.services.file.tasks.FileBrowser
  as well, but most users will only need to use of
  the FileHandle class.

+ org.gridlab.gridsphere.services.job.Job was enhanced to support
  the abilty to obtain "stdout" and "stderr" locations from it
  directly, (no need to obtain from this JobSpec after a job is
   submitted). Part of the reason for this was that
  a relative file location might be specified in JobSpec,
  and only after the job is submitted will the full / correct
  path be known. The Job interface will return the full
  location once it is known.

+ org.gridlab.gridsphere.portlets.job.JobSubmissionPortlet
  was fixed so that admins can override the default "Job Profile"
  to include only their own custom job submission user interfaces.
  This was the intended design, but it wasn't working quite right
  before.

+ JobSubmissionPortlet was enhanced so that it doesn't display
  a select box if only one JobProfile and/or JobType is
  available.

+ Several database related enhancements were made to improve
  the performance of GridPortlets. Most of these changes
  should be transparent to users, though there is some chance
  the "update-database" target will fail. Please forgive this,
  the enhancements were necessary and critical.

+ Addressed all Javadoc warnings.

+ Removed OGSA-3.0.2 jars. It seems unnecessary to support that
  version of OGSA anymore.
