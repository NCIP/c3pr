# Grid Portlets Globus configuration properties
#
# The default values should be fine for most users.
#
# HOWEVER: If you plan to use services that require the
# OGSA "httpg" pre-webservice protocol, you will need to
# set the httpgservice.resource.support property to
# true. It is false by default. Please see below.

#----------------------------------------------------------
# Globus configuration
#----------------------------------------------------------

# Install Globus flag. Set false if deploying Globus from a
# separate distribution. We recommend letting Grid Portlets
# manage the deployment of Globus libraries and services
# to your web server.
globus.install=true

# Globus version (Ex. ogsa-3.2.1)
# Supported values are:
#  - wsrf-4.0.1
#  - ogsa-3.2.1
globus.version=wsrf-4.0.1
#globus.version=ogsa-3.2.1

# Globus library dirs
globus.lib=lib/${globus.version}

# Where to deploy non-common globus core jars
# NOTE: WSRF-4.0.1 prevents logging from working when
# NOTE: when this property is set to WEB-INF/lib.
# NOTE: We have not been able to determine why.
# NOTE: This is not a problem for OGSA-3.2.1 however.
globus.deploy.core=${env.CATALINA_HOME}/shared/lib
#globus.deploy.core=${project.webapp}/WEB-INF/lib

#----------------------------------------------------------
#  OGSA Httpg service configuration
#----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Httpg service resource support.  This only applies if you
# have have set globus.version to either ogsa-3.0.2 or
# ogsa-3.2.1. Otherwise, this configuration will be
# ignored.
#
# Anwsering true means you will be _using_ resources that
# support the "httpg" protocol. In order to support the use
# of the "httpg" protcol from within Tomcat, we must alter
# the following files:
#   - $CATALINA/bin/setclasspath.sh
#   - $CATALINA/bin/setclasspath.bat
# so that they bootstrap the OGSA jars and their
# dependencies, due to Tomcat's class loading model.
#
# This will happen automagically if you set the property
# below to true.
#
# The only users who should have any real concern about
# any potential side-effects are users of Windows 2000 or
# earlier, since there is a limit in the size of the
# CLASSPATH variable in those versions of Windows.
#
# Set to false if you do not want GridPortlets to alter
# the above files. Note that you can always restore the
# original versions of the above files by running:
#   % ant catalina-restore-classpath
#httpgservice.resource.support=true
httpgservice.resource.support=false
