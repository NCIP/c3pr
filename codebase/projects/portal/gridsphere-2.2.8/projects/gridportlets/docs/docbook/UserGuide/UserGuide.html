        The Grid Portlets User's Guide describes how to use Grid Portlets for
        managing jobs and data on the Grid. Please consult the
        <a href="../AdminGuide/AdminGuide.html" target="_self">Administrator's Guide</a>
        for more information on how to administer the Grid Portlets web application. Please consult
        the <a href="../DeveloperGuide/DeveloperGuide.html" target="_self">Developer's Guide</a> for more
        information on how to use Grid Portlets to develop custom Grid portal web applications.

        The Grid Portlets web application must be installed on the same web server
        GridSphere is installed. Please consult with your portal administrator
        if this has not been done. Otherwise, you should see the "Grid Portlets"
        group in the list of available portlet groups in the Profile Manager portlet.
        Add that group to your user profile if it is not already added. Once it
        has been added, you will see a "Grid" tab in your tab bar.

        Grid Portlets provides support for delegating credentials
        to a portal with the Credential Retrieval Portlet and enables
        users to sign-on to the Grid with those credentials.
        This section describes how to obtain a Grid certificate using
        globus command line tools and how to delegate credentials to a
        MyProxy credential repository. The Credential Retrieval Portlet
        allows users to retrieve credentials from MyProxy for use with
        other portlets that require credentials. Moreover, uers can
        configure Grid Portlets to retrieve credentials from MyProxy
        when they next login.
    </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10025"></a>Obtaining Your Grid Cerftifcate</h2></div></div></div><p>
            A Grid certificate is a file which consists of your RSA public key, a period of
            validity and some user information. Grid certificates can be used for authenticating
            users to computing resources on the Grid in a process known as single sign-on.
            The steps below describe how to obtain and setup your Grid certificate for use with
            the Grid Portlets.
            In order to use Grid Portlets, we require that you obtain a
            Grid certificate from one of our accepted <a href="http://www.gridlab.org/WorkPackages/wp-5/admin/certauth.html" target="_self">Grid certificate authorities</a>.
        </p><p>
            If you do not already have a Grid cerftifcate, your instituion should provide
            command line tools or an application for obtaining a Grid certificate. For example,
            if Globus command line tools are available on your client, then you should be able to
            run the grid-cert-request program to request a certificate from a
            certificate authority.
        </p><p>
            In a unix shell, you would type the following commands:
            <pre class="screen">

    # grid-cert-request -cn '&lt;FIRSTNAME&gt; &lt;SURNAME&gt;'

            </pre>
        </p><p>
        This tool asks for a passphrase securing the private key. It creates a directory named
        ".globus" in your home directory containing the following files:

        <pre class="screen">

    usercert.pem            usercert_request.pem             userkey.pem

        </pre>
        </p><p>
            You would then send the file named "usercert_request.pem" to your site adminisitrator
            or to directly to the certificate authority, depening on how your institution has
            configured Globus. If the request is accepted, you will receive an email containing
            the certificate in a file called "usercert.pem". DO NOT LOSE THIS FILE!. Move the file
            to your ~/.globus directory.

        <pre class="screen">

            # mv usercert.pem ~/.globus/

        </pre>
        </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N10043"></a>Testing Your Grid Cerftifcate</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Next test to see that you can create a proxy with your Grid cerftificate. Proxies
                contain your credentials, which, in addition to containing your Grid certificate,
                include information for authorizing the use of your certificate.
            </p><p>
                In a unix shell, you would type the following command:
                <pre class="screen">

        # grid-proxy-init

                </pre>
            </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N1004E"></a>Delegating A Credential To MyProxy</h2></div></div></div><p>
            After you have obtained a Grid certificate, you must then delegate a credential
            to our MyProxy server at myproxy.gridlab.org using the MyProxy client
            program. MyProxy is an online repository for delegated credentials and Grid Portlets uses
            it to obtain credentials in steps 4 and 5 below so that it can sign users onto remote
            computing resources. The MyProxy client program is installed on peyote.aei.mpg.de
            and is easy to use.
        </p><p>
            In a unix shell, you would type a command similar to this:
            <pre class="screen">

    # myproxy-init -s myproxy.gridlab.org

            </pre>
        </p><p>
        A typical MyProxy dialog looks like this:
        </p><pre class="screen">

    Your identity: /O=Grid/O=GridLab/CN=Michael Russell
    Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
    Creating proxy ........................................ Done
    Proxy Verify OK
    Your proxy is valid until: Thu Jul 15 11:52:18 2004
    Enter MyProxy pass phrase:
    Verifying password - Enter MyProxy pass phrase:
    A proxy valid for 168 hours (7.0 days) for user russell now exists on myproxy.gridlab.org.

        </pre><p>
            Your <code class="code">GRID pass phrase</code> is the pass phrase you used to generate a private key
            for your Grid certificate. The <code class="code">MyProxy pass phrase</code> is the password you would
            like to use for delegating proxies to Grid Portlets. Use a password that is easy to type
            and easy to remember. You will use this password in steps 4 and 5 below. Note that the
            credential that is delegated to MyProxy has a lifetime of 7 days. This means you
            must repeat this step every 7 days! Alternatively, you can specify a longer lifetime.
            Type <code class="code">myproxy-init -help</code> for more information on how to use MyProxy.

            Now that you have delegated a credential to MyProxy, you can delegate a credential
            from MyProxy to Grid Portlets for use on the Grid.

                Login to Grid Portlets if you haven't already. If you
                have not added the "Grid Portlets" group to your user
                profile, please do so with the <a href="?cid=profile" target="_self">Profile Manager</a> when you
                first logon. Then go to the <a href="?cid=CredentialRetrievalPortlet" target="_self">Credential Retrieval
                Portlet</a> located under the <a href="?cid=Grid Portlets" target="_self">Grid</a> tab. Click on
                <span class="guibutton">New Credential</span> and specify the credential
                you delegated to MyProxy in step 3.
                <div class="figure"><a name="N10083"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Retrieving A Credential</b></p><div><img src="media/NewCredential.jpg" alt="Retrieving A Credential"></div></div>
            </p><p>
                The information you specify depends on what options you used with the MyProxy client program:
                <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Credential Label - The label to display in Grid Portlets for this credential. For
                example, if you had used a certificate signed by the GridLab Certificate Authority, you could
                enter "GridLab Certificate" here.</li><li>User Name - Maps to the <code class="code">-l option</code> in <code class="code">myproxy-init</code>. If
                you did not specify this option, then it will the same as the name of the account under which
                you ran the MyProxy client program.</li><li>Credential Name - This is an optional field so it can be left blank. It maps to the
                <code class="code">-n option</code> in <code class="code">myproxy-init</code>.</li><li>Pass Phrase - This should be the same as the <code class="code">MyProxy pass phrase</code> you
                provided to <code class="code">myproxy-init</code>.</li><li>Single Sign-On - Leave this option checked so that you can login to Grid Portlets
                with the pass phrase you enter here in step 5.</li></ul></div>
            </p><p>
                Once you've successfully delegated your credential to Grid Portlets, Grid Portlets will
                keep a record of this credential for future use. You will notice that the credential that is
                delegated to Grid Portlets has a shorter lifetime than the credential delegated to MyProxy.
                This is for security reasons. If this credential expires while you are still
                logged in to Grid Portlets, you can simply return
                to the <a href="?cid=CredentialRetrievalPortlet" target="_self">Credential Retrieval
                Portlet</a>, enter your MyProxy pass phrase into the Pass Phrase field and
                click <span class="guibutton">Retrieve Credentials</span>. This will
                delegate a new credential to Grid Portlets.
                <div class="figure"><a name="N100B4"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;List of Credentials</b></p><div><img src="media/CredentialList.jpg" alt="List of Credentials"></div></div>

                    If you completed step 4 successfully, you are already signed onto the Grid for as long as
                    your credential's lifetime. When you next logon to Grid Portlets, simply enter
                    your Portal username and use the pass phrase you used to delegate a credential to MyProxy.
                    This will simultaneously log you in to Grid Portlets and delegate a new credential to
                    the portal. This process is called "single sign-on". You are now ready to use the Grid!
