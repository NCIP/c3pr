===========================================================
  Grid Portlets Support For The Globus Toolkit

  This file describes which versions of the Globus Toolkit
  are supported by the GridSphere Project.

===========================================================

Support for GT2
--------------------------------------

By default, Grid Portlets supports Globus Toolkit 2.4
services (such as Globus Gatekeeper, Grid Ftp, and Mds2),
as well as provides support for hosting and using OGSA
3.2.1 services.

Support for OGSA
--------------------------------------

In fact, installing Grid Portlets means you don't have
to install OGSA separately. However, if you do plan
to install OGSA separately, then you should take a look
at ./config/build/build-globus.properties. This file
contains the properties for configuring whether or not
Grid Portlets should install OGSA and where OGSA jars
are located.

  - Special note: Support for "HTTPG" -

  If you intend to use services that require the OGSA
  pre-webservice "httpg" protocol, please take a look
  at ./config/build/build-globus.properties for how to
  enable this support.

Support for GT3
--------------------------------------

Support for GT3 is available in the "GT3 Portlets" project,
available in the "gt3portlets" module in the GridSphere
CVS. Please see our website for how to access this CVS.

The GT3 Portlets project contains GT3 service
implementations of the Grid Portlets Services API.
Currently, only support for MMJFS has been developed.
If you are interested in support for other GT3 services,
please contact our gridsphere-dev mail list (see
README.txt) and express your interest. We are currently
looking for contributors!

Support for GT4
--------------------------------------

Support for GT4 is coming soon. We are working with
colleagues to develop a "GT4 Portlets" project. We will
be making announcements in the very near future!


Thanks for you interest in Grid Portlets!
