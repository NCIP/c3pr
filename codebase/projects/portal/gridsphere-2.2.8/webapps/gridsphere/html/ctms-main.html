                This workspace is developing a comprehensive set of modular, interoperable and standards-based tools designed to
                meet the diverse clinical trials management needs. The tools developed will be configurable to meet the needs of
                Cancer Centers with little or no clinical data management systems in place as well as those with robust systems,
                and will take into account the diversity of clinical research activities and local practices that exist among
                these Cancer Centers.
