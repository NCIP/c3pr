    <b>Using the Role Manager portlet</b>
</p>

<p>
    The Role Manager portlet is used for managing roles in the portal. Roles can be added, modified and deleted except
    for
    the core GridSphere roles, <i>GUEST</i>, <i>USER</i>, <i>ADMIN</i> and <i>SUPER</i> that also match the core
    role priority levels supported by the portal. A Guest role priority is reserved for non-logged in users, User role
    priority is used for any logged in user, Admin is generally used for some kind of administrator functionality and
    super would have essentially have no access restrictions. Roles can also be defined by an individual webapp by
    specifying a <i>roles.xml<</i> role descriptor. See the GridSphere reference Guide for more information.
