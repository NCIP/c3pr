    <b>Using the Tracking Statistics portlet</b>
</p>

<p>
    The Tracking Statistics portlet provides portal usedr tracking details including actions that are invoked from the
    portal.
    Information provided consists of a timestamp, the client's browser e.g. "User-Agent" string received by the portal,
    and the user name if action was invoked by a logged in user. New tracking actions may be added via the portlet. An
    action name generally corresponds to the action name specified in the hyperlink, form or submit buton of the portlet
    and is found by looking at the actual source code, or just by viewing the page source to find the action name
    in the HTML. Only actions that are "enabled" will be tracked. Information on actions can also be downloaded in Excel
    spreadsheet format for further offline statistics/charting generation.
