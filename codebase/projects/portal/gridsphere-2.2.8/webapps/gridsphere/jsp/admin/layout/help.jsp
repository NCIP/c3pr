    <b>Using the Layout Manager portlet</b>
</p>

<p>
    The Layout Manager portlet lets you customize your theme and entire portal layout.
    Various options are provided to allow you to rename, create and delete portlet tab titles
    and sub tab titles. Portlets within a subtab can be arranged into table layouts with
    the desired columns and rows. Only those portlets to which you are subscribed may be added.
