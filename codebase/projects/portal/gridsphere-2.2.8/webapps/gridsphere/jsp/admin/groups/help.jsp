    <b>Using the Group Administration portlet</b>
</p>

<p>
    The Group Administration portlet is used for adding and removing portal users to groups. A group is defined
    by a deployed portlet web application. New users are initially in the core GridSphere group but may be
    added to existing groups. Simply select the group to add or remove users from and then confirm changes.
