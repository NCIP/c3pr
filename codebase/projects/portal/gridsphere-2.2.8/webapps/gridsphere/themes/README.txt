GridSphere Theme Support
------------------------

GS supports two pluggable look and feels (PLAF)s: classic and standard. The classic PLAF remains the old (GS 2.1.2 and earlier) look and feel using a combination of nested tables and some CSS. The current default PLAF is standard which is evolving towards a much more configurable pure CSS layout. Each PLAF supports multiple themes inside each of the PLAF subdirectories. If you are interested in developing a new theme, please use the standard PLAF and have a look at the CSS files.
